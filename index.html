            Judy Hopps is a bunny and the main character in Disney 2016 film
            Zootopia. She is a rabbit living in BunnyBurrow on her family carrot
            farm. She dreams of being a police officer, in the big city of
            Zootopia, even though there never been a bunny cop before. Alot of
            others animals try to crush her dreams, but Judy is fiercly
            determinated. I think Judy is a wonderful example of how anyone
            human or animal can reach there dreams if they never give up.

          “When I was a kid, I thought    Zootopia was
          this perfect place where everyone got along and anyone could be
          anything. Turns out, real life's a little bit more complicated than a
          slogan on a bumper sticker. Real life is messy. We all have
          limitations. We all make mistakes. Which means―hey, glass half
          full!―we all have a lot in common. And the more we try to understand
          one another, the more exceptional each of us will be. But we have to
          try. So no matter what type of animal you are, from the biggest
          elephant to our first fox, I implore you: try. Try to make the world a
          better place. Look inside yourself and recognize that change starts
          with you. It starts with me. It starts with all of us.”
